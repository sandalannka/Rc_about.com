<p> <em>FF4 RC JET PLANE</em> is created by wishwana</p>



    <h5 style="color:red">We are made in rc plane for innovation. Recieving will to be make Rc plane in tthis web site So your joint for web and<br>get Air knowledge about project of doing to different need too. </h5>
    <p><strong>Your see in follow details and doing according to it.</strong></p>

 <p> First,   plane about, what isyour make type of plane (these web is support by RC jet plane).your made,</p>
   
  <br> <p> you should buy and brought these equipment your need KT board for material of body.<br>these are prices are not in this page.</p>

<p><strong>You should take above components and follow below steps.  this is RC plane made to enjoible, project of exhibition. develope your plane skills to help us then,<br>now you are take and print plane of RC body.
it need to a plan is have this web you can print it. RC plane is controll fly sky in to cufirg mig is call, then you printed and drawn plan is collect.</strong></p>

<h4><ol>2  <strong>Now put on the your boad and cut around the plan from paper cutter. and mark on the line after take out the plan so do again by again for this way.</strong></ol></h4>

<h4> <ol>3  <strong>Now cutted parts are ready and paste from glue gun for hardness therefore mig, take space (did not paste of)electric componnet covered part from board. and drying foe few minutes. </strong></ol></h4> 
<br>
<p> You are cutted parts are fix during put the glue from hot glue gun and do to hardness and wait. then your follow above and below rules & steps<br>
you must have knowledge to see follw images to get more knowns.</p>

<h5>Now follow next step before that check your result to the rc project</h5>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><strong>4  Now you must fix and connect the fixed part then, you have fixed parts are paste to(doesn't change).</strong></h4>
<br>
<p>you,?? acording to above steps too, you are paste the fixed part brushless motor, servo motor, servo motor connected clipsa are on the board. then, you should toke parts after wait<br>
 for few moments later. see follow image to more known and do it care fully.then,  but you don't close circuit space.</p>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>host is think Now your did it, so, you are check whether the paste in hardnesses and put the wires in hall for properly. then brushless motor, micros.motor, clips are properly.</p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><strong>5  Now you shold connect the wires to equipments then, wires are are connetion to ?!!! and put the remaind equipment.</strong></h4> 
<br>
<p> you should have commponents are fix or take in on the board to connection, after you are conncet the wires to recieving inpiuts so,<br> It's connect properly.<p>
<br>

<br>
<br>
<p> now coonected commponent are above image according to havend.you must correctly coonect the wires,check for it<p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h5>follow advices and doent close upper board. you first cnnect motorto esc and it to connect the reciever then reciever to connected the servo motor, you follow the above 
 steps tharoly.<br>you shold have motor connect last but u are charge and find it voltage, amphere, kw from nessery to or sizes<h5>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h4><strong>6 last then we are connect the battery for power supply, after close the on coveres and power up</strong></h4>
<br>
<br>
<h5>we did rc plane is recieve up power, so you shall connect wiree to the battery and paste/close the circuit body cover from kt board, then you should charged battery !!..Now you switch on the plane and throow the plane to releses doe to controll from trasmitter</h5>

<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>We fixed the equipment after connect the Battery for powersupply, So close the circuit part and channel the part of transmitter (flysky)<br>then release the  plan from turn onned.
